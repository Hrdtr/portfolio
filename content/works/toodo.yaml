  Toodo is a mobile application that is useful for logging the tasks of each project that the user is currently running, all data stored in the cloud using appwrite as a backend. For the frontend itself, Toodo is made using the Ionic 4 framework. This project is a personal project and was completed in 2 days.
  Some of the features embedded in it include: account authentication, project management, task management, task completion and dark mode.
  This project has access to the PWA version found in the links section of this page. I provide a demo account to the public with email: demo@toodo-app.cognitive.id, and password: demo1234
