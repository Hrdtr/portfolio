  Nuxt is a popular web-based frontend framework built on top of Vue.JS, and Appwrite itself is a secure Open-Source backend server.
  Nuxt-Appwrite is a Nuxt Module which is intended to facilitate the integration of Nuxt and Appwrite as a backend in the application development process. In simple terms, this module packs Appwrite's 2 SDKs, namely web-sdk and nodejs-sdk, into a single npm package which is easy to activate and configure in Nuxt.
